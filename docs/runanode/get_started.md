# Get started


## What to expect

Running a Minima node simply means that you will become a participant in the Minima network. 

On the device that you choose to run Minima on, you will:
- get your own non-custodial Minima wallet 
- have direct access to the blockchain
- receive, process and confirm all Minima transactions
- send your own transactions directly to the chain
- be able to add contacts for peer-to-peer messaging over Maxima
- access all of Minima's MiniDapps
