With a single PoW value equal to the sum of the smaller parts. Everyone benefits from the total work done. This would work well in a transaction based security protocol. All the transactions could do a small amount of work, and then sum all of that up into single blocks. This way Minima removes the miners but keeps the blockchain as the single PoW-secured time-ordered list of events. "),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Each transaction in Minima is PoW mined. The process is very similar to searching for blocks on any other PoW blockchain. When you find a Tx-PoW that satisfies the network allowed difficulty, 10s average work per device, your transaction may be broadcast, relayed across the network, and added to blocks. The network can determine the minimum Tx-PoW by averaging recent transactions. But, this is also how the blockchain is constructed, since if by chance your Tx-PoW value is high enough, determined by the network to be 1 Tx-PoW every 50 seconds, you have not only mined your transaction but you have also mined a block, that users can add to the current chain. The more transactions being sent the higher this block difficulty will be. Users wanting to send transactions, construct a Tx-PoW header that is foremost a record of their own transaction and as an adjunct a block header that represents their current view of the network. Since blocks only store the hashes of transactions, like Compact blocks in Bitcoin, they are of negligible size. A 10KB block would hold about 330 transaction hashes. Finding a block is the most secure action a user can do to safeguard their coins and honest blocks help sustain the health of the network. For the user, this is all seamless. Whenever a user sends a transaction, sometimes they also find a block."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The Tx-PoW chain lends itself well to GHOST",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"/docs/learn/minimawhitepaper/specialthanksto"},"[7]")," as transactions are added to blocks even if they themselves are blocks.
