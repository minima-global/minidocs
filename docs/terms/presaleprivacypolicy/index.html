COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA<a class="hash-link" href="#5-collection-of-personal-data" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>5.1 When User uses the Services Minima will collect information, including Personal Data, for the purpose of providing, maintaining and improving the Services, as well as complying with applicable laws or regulations. Minima collects Personal Data primarily in three (3) ways:</p><p>5.2 Information user voluntarily provides to minima: When User contacts Minima’s support team (by email, phone or contact form on the Website) with respect to the Website or Services related issues or communicates with Minima in any way, User voluntarily gives Minima information that Minima collects and processes and this Privacy Policy. The Minima information may include Personal Data such as: name, email address, phone number, and address. When User voluntarily submits Personal Data with their inquiry or request pertaining to the Services, Minima will process any such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In some cases, Minima may require additional information, including Personal Data, in order to identify User while processing their inquiry or request. Minima may also maintain a record of such communications with Users, including any follow-ups and subsequent feedback, for internal purposes.</p><p>5.3 Some of the Services require registration. When creating an account with Minima, Account Users and Direct Users will have to provide Personal Data, including name, email address and password (together, ”Registration Information”), in order to be able to use the respective Services.</p><p>5.4 Subscribers will have to provide their email address for the purpose of receiving the communications to which they have subscribed.</p><p>5.5 Information minima collects through user’s use of the services: Information Minima collects automatically. Each time Users use the Services, Minima collects information relating but not limited to: (i) which Services are used; (ii) all the areas within the Services that User visits; (iii) the time of day when User accesses and uses the Services; (iv) actions taken by User when using and interacting with the Services; (v) which Services or parts thereof generate error messages; and (vi) User’s browser, operating system and internet protocol (“IP”) address. Minima collects this information automatically as part of its technical log files or other metadata, as well as through the use of cookies, web beacons and other similar tracking technologies. All personally identifiable information collected through User’s use of the Services is treated as Personal Data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Minima may also use the collected information in an anonymous and/or aggregate way (i.e., it is not personally identifiable in this state) for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to improving user experience, enhancing the Services and developing new services (see “Use of Non-Personal Data”).</p><p>5.6 Information collected by Cookies: A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to access a service. Cookies or similar technologies may be used for many purposes, including without limitation remembering the User and User’s preferences and tracking User’s visits to the Website or access to the Services. Cookies work by assigning a number to User that has no meaning outside of the assigning website or application. Minima uses cookies for various purposes, including without limitation tracking User’s movements within the Website, analyzing trends, gathering statistical data and improving user experience and the overall quality of the Services. Minima encodes and encrypts the cookies so that only Minima can interpret the information stored in them. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within User’s web browser or on User’s device. Thus, if User does not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, User can restrict or limit the use of cookies at the individual browser or device level. However, if User chooses to disable cookies some features of the Services may not function properly or Minima may not be able to customize the delivery of information to User.</p><p>5.7 First-Party Cookies: Minima uses session cookies and persistent cookies when User uses the Services. These are essential to the operation of the Website and the provision of Services. The session cookie is stored in temporary memory and is not retained after the browser is closed. Session cookies do not collect information from User’s computer. They store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify the User. The persistent cookies are set with expiration date and are stored on User’s hard drive until they expire or User deletes them. Minima does not collect any Personal Data in the session and persistent cookies. Minima uses session and persistent cookies for technical purposes, including but not limited to verifying the origin of requests, distributing requests among multiple servers, authenticating Users and determining what functionality of the Services such Users are allowed to access.</p><p>5.8 Third-Party Cookies: Minima also uses third-party cookies. These third-party service providers with whom Minima has contracted help analyze certain online activities and provide analytics services.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="6-use-of-information">6.

Such safeguards aim to ensure an adequate level of protection of Personal Data. Minima may disclose or transfer Personal Data to such Third-Party Providers solely for the identified purposes and solely in connection with the Services. Minima will restrict access to Personal Data to what is strictly necessary for the performance of such Third-Party Provider’s contractual obligations. Such Third-Party Providers may process, store and/or have access to Personal Data. Any transfer of Personal Data of EU/EEA Users to a Third-Party Provider located in a third country will be subject to articles 45 and 46 of the GDPR and will take place either </p><p>(i) on the basis of an adequacy decision by the European Commission, or </p><p>(ii) by entering into the standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, or by ensuring the respective Third-Party Provider has signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield. At the date of this Privacy Policy Minima uses the following Third-Party Providers:</p><p>7.3.1 Data Disclosure</p><p>7.4 Disclosure for Legal Reasons: Minima may disclose Personal Data without User’s Consent when Minima believes in good faith that the disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary or appropriate:</p><p>7.4.1 to comply with the Data Protection Laws, any subpoena, enforceable request from the competent authorities, or other legal process;</p><p>7.4.2 to enforce Minima’s rights against User or in connection with a breach by User of any user terms in force and, as applicable, the End User Licence Agreement, including investigation of potential violations;</p><p>7.4.3 to help detect, curb or investigate fraud or other prohibited or illegal activities that affect or hurt the interests of Minima or third parties;</p><p>7.4.4 to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), Minima’s rights or property, other Users of the Services, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities; and</p><p>7.4.5 to help Minima comply with a legal obligation to which Minima is subject, or accounting or security requirements, in which case Minima may disclose such information to its auditors, professional consultants, accountants and/or legal advisors. In all the foregoing cases, Minima will disclose Personal Data only to the extent required or permitted by the applicable Data Protection Laws.</p><p>7.5 Transfer of Ownership: User’s Personal Data may be disclosed and/or transferred upon change of control as a result of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Minima’s assets or stock, merger, acquisition or reorganization, including any due diligence process carried out in relation to the same, provided that the Personal Data disclosed continues to be used solely for the purposes permitted by, and subject to the provisions in, this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring access to such information. If the entire or substantial ownership of Minima or Services were to change, User’s Personal Data may be transferred to the new owner to ensure continuity of the Services. In any such transfer of ownership User’s Personal Data will remain subject to the promises of the then and current Privacy Policy. Minima will provide reasonable advance notice to User via the Website of any such change in ownership or control of User’s Personal Data or in case such Personal Data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="8-controller-and-processor">8.

Minima shall not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from access to User’s account through Registration Information or Credentials obtained from User or through violation of this Privacy Policy or the user terms.</p><p>13.1.2 Although Minima will take reasonable steps to ensure that User’s Personal Data is treated and stored securely, unfortunately, the sending of information via the Internet is not totally secure and on occasion such information may be intercepted. Therefore, Minima can’t guarantee the security of Personal Data that User chooses voluntarily to send to Minima electronically. Minima expressly disclaims all liability for any interception or interruption of any Internet transmissions sent by User or any losses of or changes to data, including Personal Data, resulting from such interception or interruption.</p><p>13.2 Personal Data Safeguards: Minima is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of the Personal Data of Users.

Minima strictly restricts access to Personal Data in accordance with specific internal procedures governing access to such information. Minima carefully selects the individuals privileged with access to Personal Data in accordance with internal security policies and practices, and each such individual is bound by confidentiality obligations. The Services ensure secure communications with TLS encryption. To maintain the security of online sessions and protect Minima’s systems from unauthorized access, Minima uses a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others. Access to Minima’s systems requires multiple levels of authentication, including biometric recognition procedures. Security personnel monitor the systems 24/7. Minima databases are both physically and logically protected from general employee access. Minima enforces physical controls on its premises. Minima is routinely verified for its use of encryption technologies and audited for its privacy practices. Minima tests its systems, the Website and Services infrastructure for any failure points that might allow hacking.</p><p>13.3 Data Pseudonymization: In addition to the technical and organizational security measures employed by Minima to ensure security, confidentiality and integrity of Personal Data, Minima also uses data pseudonymization technique when processing and storing Personal Data in its systems. Pseudonymization consists of replacing the data fields which are the most identifying in a data record with pseudonyms. Personal Data which has undergone pseudonymization can no longer be attributed to a specific User without the use of additional information, and such additional information is kept by Minima separately and is subject to appropriate technical and organizational security measures to ensure that such pseudonymized Personal Data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="14-notification-of-personal-data-breach">14.
