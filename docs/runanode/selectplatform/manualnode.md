# Desktop Command Line

:::note Please Note
The following process is for running a Minima node manually. You must leave your desktop running at all times for Minima to continue running and must update your node manually when new versions become available.
:::

## Start a new Minima node

Before starting, ensure you have the latest version of Java installed from https://java.com/en/

1. Download and save the latest minima.jar file from Github [here](https://github.com/minima-global/Minima/raw/master/jar/minima.jar)

2. Open your command line interface<br/>
**Windows**: Click on Start, search for **command prompt** then right click to **Open as administrator**<br/>
**Mac:** Open the Terminal app from the Utilities folder in Applications

3. Type the following command all on one line, replacing **`INSERTUSERNAME`** with the username for your files:<br/>

> **Tip:** To avoid typing in the folder path, you can drag and drop the downloaded minima.jar file into the command line window.

#### Windows
```
java -jar C:\Users\INSERTUSERNAME\Downloads\minima.jar -mdsenable -mdspassword [insertpasswordhere]
```
#### Mac
```
sudo java -jar /Users/INSERTUSERNAME/Downloads/minima.jar -mdsenable -mdspassword [insertpasswordhere]
```
#### Linux
```
sudo java -jar /home/INSERTUSERNAME/minima.jar -mdsenable -mdspassword [insertpasswordhere]
```

#### Optional start up parameters

<details>
<summary>Expand to see full list of start up parameters</summary>

The following start up parameters can optionally be specified when starting your node. 

To add/remove parameters after a node has been started, you must `quit` the node and restart it, adding/removing the required parameters. 

`[]` square brackets indicate where an input is required, **the brackets should not be included.**

#### General
- `-clean` : CAREFUL! Clears existing data, starts a new fresh node. All coins will be lost.<br/>

</details>

4. Hit the **Enter** key

5. Avoid
- Closing the Command Prompt/Terminal
- Allowing your PC to go to sleep
- Turning your PC off

If any of the above happen, your Minima node will stop running and you will need to repeat step 3 to start it again.

Minima is now started, your output should look similar to the below and you should start to see the logs running.
```
Minima @ 14/03/2022 17:32:30 [5.1 MB] : **********************************************
Minima @ 14/03/2022 17:32:30 [5.1 MB] : *  __  __  ____  _  _  ____  __  __    __    *

```

**Congratulations - your node is now installed & running!**

You can type `status` to show the status of your Minima node, or `help` to show the full list of commands.

## Secure your node 

Before using your node for the first time, you must:

1. Write down your Seed Phrase
2. Take a backup
3. Lock your wallet (optional)

Please visit the User guides section to learn how. 

---------

## Login to your node

The first time accessing your MiniDapp hub, you may need to pass through the security warning - see below - as the MiniDapp system currently uses self-signed certificates.

:::note custom ports
Note that **9003** is the default port for accessing your MiniDapp system - if you installed Minima on custom ports, you will need to use your custom base port + 2. E.g. If you installed Minima on 8001, you will need to use **https://127.0.0.1:8003/**
:::

Go to **https://127.0.0.1:9003/** in your web browser. You may have to proceed past the security warning, since Minima uses self-signed certificates. Learn how [**here**](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-bypass-the-https-warning-for-self-signed-ssl-tls-certificates/).

You will see the login page to your node.

![mds_login](/img/runanode/mds_login.png#width50)

2. If you set one, use the password you set as your `-mdspassword` when starting the node. To check your **password** you can return to your desktop command line/terminal where the Minima logs are running and enter 

```
mds
```

You should see an output similar to below:

```
mds
{
  "command":"mds",
  "status":true,
  "response":{
    "password":"1SV0-F0WN-K367",
    "minidapps":[]
  }
}
```
3. Copy and Paste your password into the field and click **Enter**
4. You will see your MiniDapp hub!

Please see the [first steps](#first-steps) to complete now your node is running.

## First steps

The first time you install Minima, you must 

1. Connect to the network
2. Write down your seed phrase

Please refer to the [user guides](/docs/userguides/newusers/jointhenetwork) to learn how.


-------

## Using the MiniDapp hub

By default, all MiniDapps will be given **READ** permission when you install them.

When a MiniDapp with READ permission attempts to run a command which would make changes to your node or require access to your funds, a PENDING command will be created which you will need to accept. 
:::warning 
You should only give **WRITE** permissions to MiniDapps that you trust. <br/>
Only the **Terminal** MiniDapp will need **WRITE** permission so you can approve/deny transactions.
:::

### Setting the Terminal permissions to WRITE

1. Login to your MiniDapp hub and install the Terminal MiniDapp from the [MiniDapp site](https://minidapps.minima.global/). 
2. Return to your desktop command line/terminal and run the `mds` command again (see above) to list your MiniDapps and check their existing permissions
3. You will see the Terminal MiniDapp listed, **copy the uid from YOUR node**
```
    {
      "uid":"0xB4C47D4AD267C3D2D4EF6E086FD12845",
      "conf":{
        "name":"Terminal",
        "icon":"terminal.png",
        "version":"1.91",
        "description":"Terminal CLI for Minima",
        "permission":"write",
        "browser":"internal"
      }
    },
```
4. Run the following command in the Command line/Terminal where the Minima logs are running, **pasting in YOUR uid**:

**Windows/Mac/Linux Desktop**
```
mds action:permission uid:0x02FA22EF2A2A3B0FA01D688A902779E5 trust:write
```

**You may now use the Terminal MiniDapp to execute all commands** - you will no longer need to use your desktop command line interface/Terminal. 


-------

## How to check the Status of your node
You can use the Terminal MiniDapp to interact with your node, for example to check your node version, status, balance, password, Incentive Program setup or to create a backup.

The `status` command will show details of your node including version, last block and chain details.

1. Type `status` into the command line/Terminal.
2. Check `block` and `time`, this is your tip block and the time of that block, `time` should be within a few minutes of the current time.

![Desktop_manualstatus](/img/runanode/docker_vps_terminalstatus.png)

:::info checking your node is in sync
Having a recent block time is not a guarantee that you are on the right chain. <br/>
Consider cross checking your latest block with another node or checking the `samechain` response of your Maxima Contacts by running the `maxcontacts` command.

If the time shown is significantly behind, you should restart your node to resync to the chain. If it doesn't catch up automatically, youu may need to perform a [**chain resync**](/docs/userguides/recovery/chainresync) from an Archive node.
:::

**Other useful commands:**<br/>
`mds` - find the password for your node<br/>
`help` - show all commands


## How to update your node

1. Type **quit** into the Command prompt/Terminal window where the Minima logs are running
2. Download and save the latest minima.jar file from Github [here](https://github.com/minima-global/Minima/blob/master/jar/minima.jar?raw=true).
3. Replace your existing minima.jar file with the latest version
4. Restart Minima using the command in step 3 in [Start a new Minima node](#start-a-new-minima-node).

:::note Starting a Clean node
To create a fresh install of a node **-clean** can be added on to the end of the start up command<br/>
DO NOT use **-clean** if you are simply restarting your node, your coins will be wiped and you will only be able to recover them from a backup! <br/>
e.g. java -jar C:\Users\Username\Downloads\minima.jar -mdsenable -clean
:::


## How to remove your node
:::important
**Removing a node without taking a backup will delete all your coins! Only remove a node if you have taken a backup or are running a test node.**
:::

1. Type **quit** into the Command prompt/Terminal window where the Minima logs are running
2. Delete the minima.jar file you downloaded
3. (Optional) Remove the minima database files located in your home directory (you may need to show hidden files)


## Next Steps

Once your node running, you will need to [join the network](/docs/userguides/newusers/jointhenetwork).
