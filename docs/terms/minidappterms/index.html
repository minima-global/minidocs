If you buy Cryptoassets, you may not get back the full amount you spent on them, or anything at all. The value of Cryptoassets may depend on fluctuations in the financial markets, or other economic factors, which are outside our control. The past performance of a Cryptoassets is not a guide to the future performance of Cryptoassets.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>The prices of Cryptoassets are extremely volatile</strong></li></ol><p>Fluctuations in the price of Cryptoassets are subject to significant price volatility. The prices of Cryptoassets have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. A range of factors may influence the market price, if any, of Cryptoassets, including, but not limited to: </p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(i) the ability (if any) of Cryptoassets to trade on a secondary market;</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(ii) global supply and demand;</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(iii) general expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates and exchange rates;</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(iv) changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying Cryptoassets;</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(v) changes in the rights, obligations, incentives, or rewards for holders of Cryptoassets;</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(vii) interruptions in service from or failures of exchanges on which Cryptoassets are traded;</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(viii) investment and trading activities of large purchasers, including private and registered funds, that may directly or indirectly invest in Cryptoassets;</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(ix) monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(x) regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of Cryptoassets and changes in Applicable Law;</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(xi) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; and</p><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->(xii) expectations among participants that the value of a particular Cryptoasset or Cryptoassets generally will soon change.</p><p>A decrease in the price of a single cryptoasset may cause volatility in the entire cryptoasset industry and may affect the Cryptoassets available via our MiniDapps. Volatility in the price of Cryptoassets may result in significant loss over a short period of time.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Risk of losing access to Cryptoassets due to loss of private key(s) and wallet(s)</strong></li></ol><p>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to deal in Cryptoassets. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing Cryptoassets will result in loss of such Cryptoassets. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use (including the Minima Wallet), may be able to misappropriate your Cryptoassets.</p><p>Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the wallet you use to receive and store Cryptoassets, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such wallet, may also result in the loss of your Cryptoassets. Failure to precisely follow any procedures set forth by us for dealing in Cryptoassets, including, for instance, providing an incorrect wallet address, or using incompatible wallet(s), may result in the loss of Cryptoassets you hold.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Regulatory risks</strong></li></ol><p>Regulation of Cryptoassets and the offering thereof, as well as blockchain technologies, and cryptoasset exchanges is currently underdeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve. Regulation varies significantly between different jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Regulators may in the future adopt laws, regulations, guidance or other actions that may severely impact the development and operation of MiniDapps and the adoption and utility of Cryptoassets.</p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Risks associated with the blockchain protocol</strong></li></ol><p>Because Cryptoassets are based on blockchain protocols, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of a blockchain protocol may have a material adverse effect on Cryptoassets. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to Cryptoassets by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the blockchain protocol.</p><ol start="6"><li><strong>Risk of hacking and software and security weaknesses</strong></li></ol><p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with Cryptoassets in a variety of ways, including malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing, as well as attacks which overpower the consensus-based mechanism on which the blockchain is built and attacks which interfere with or otherwise cause nodes to malfunction (nodes are computers / hardware devices that help maintain the blockchain).</p><p>There is also an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories we use could contain Viruses or Vulnerabilities. Viruses or Vulnerabilities could cause, inter alia, complete loss of Cryptoassets, or could negatively affect the operation of MiniDapps.</p><ol start="7"><li><strong>Forks and Airdrops</strong></li></ol><p>The underlying protocols of Cryptoassets may be subject to substantial changes in their operating rules (called a “forks”), and these may alter the value or function of a Cryptoasset. A fork may result in multiple versions of a Cryptoasset, leading to volatility as one version becomes dominant over another, which may lose its value.</p><p>There may be additional distributions (called an “airdrop”) made to holders of a particular Cryptoasset, which may be a new variant of a Cryptoasset or a further quantity of the same Cryptoasset. The (anticipated) occurrence of an airdrop may impact the value of the Cryptoasset(s) affected by that airdrop.</p><ol start="8"><li><strong>Other potential risks applicable to Cryptoassets</strong></li></ol><p>In addition to the risks included in this Schedule 1, there are other risks associated with dealing in Cryptoassets, including those that we cannot reasonably foresee. Additional risks may also materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed above in this Schedule 1.</p><p>Where you deal in any Cryptoasset you should take care to understand the risks involved. It is usual for the issuer of the Cryptoasset to provide an explanation of the risks involved (or if they have not, this can be an indicator that a Cryptoasset is particularly risky as there has been a lack of consideration of the risks relevant to that Cryptoasset). By dealing in any Cryptoasset, you confirm to us that you have taken to time to understand, and accept, the risks involved (including in respect of the risks as explained by the issuer of the Cryptoasset).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="minima-specific-risks">Minima specific risks<a href="#minima-specific-risks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Minima specific risks" title="Direct link to Minima specific risks">​</a></h4><p>As noted elsewhere in these Terms, Minima is not sold as securities nor any other form of regulated investment product. Accordingly, there has not been any consideration as to whether the Minima is a suitable or an appropriate thing for you to deal in. In addition to the risks applicable to all Cryptoassets as detailed above, you should be aware of the following risks in relation to Minima specifically:</p><ol><li><strong>Lack of operating history</strong></li></ol><p>Purchases of Minima involve a high degree of risk. The utility and value of Minima is reliant on the success of the Minima Blockchain and ecosystem. As such, Minima has all of the risks and uncertainties normally associated with developing and operating a blockchain, lack of name recognition, potential lack of resources, difficulties in complying with all Applicable Law, and reliance on the development of the Minima Blockchain ecosystem. These risks are significant.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Risks associated with uncertain regulation</strong></li></ol><p>The regulatory status of the Minima may be unclear or unsettled in certain jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to Minima and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, such as the Minima Blockchain. Regulatory actions could negatively impact Minima in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Minima is a regulated financial instrument that requires registration or licensing. Participants in Minima may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to Applicable Law, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or if it becomes commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p><p>More generally, the Minima Blockchain is pioneered on new and evolving technology, which increases legal complexity, particularly as the Applicable Law is subject to interpretation and change. This could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines as well as the requirement that some or all MiniDapps are restricted or prohibited in certain jurisdictions. These developments could have an adverse effect on the operations of the Minima Blockchain and the value of Minima.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Legal proceedings and litigation</strong></li></ol><p>From time to time, participants in Minima may be involved in legal proceedings or litigation. The results of such legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and, regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on the development of the Minima Blockchain ecosystem. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect people’s perception of the Minima Blockchain ecosystem, regardless of whether the allegations are valid. Accordingly, litigation may adversely affect the value of Minima.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Intellectual property</strong></li></ol><p>Companies, organisations, or individuals, including competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks, or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with the use and development of Minima and the Minima Blockchain, which could make it more difficult for the Minima Blockchain ecosystem to operate, reducing the value of Minima.</p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Minima will have no refund rights or similar features and may have limited liquidity</strong></li></ol><p>After issuance, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law you will have no ability to return Minima or to receive a refund or otherwise require that Minima be exchangeable for a certain value. As a result, if there is not sufficient demand or interest in the Minima Blockchain or Minima, or if there are limits on the transferability of, or limited liquidity for, Minima, then it may be of less value to participants.</p><ol start="6"><li><strong>Future distribution of Minima and other types of token</strong></li></ol><p>The distribution of a substantial number of Minima or additional types of token could have an adverse effect on the value of Minima. Any distribution of Minima could dilute the percentage interest in then-outstanding Minima, and have an adverse effect on the market value of the Minima. Additional new types of cryptoasset may also impact the value of Minima, and you have no rights in relation to such new types of cryptoasset as a result of entering into these Terms.</p><ol start="7"><li><strong>Developing the ecosystem</strong></li></ol><p>The ecosystem around the Minima Blockchain requires resources to develop and maintain, including financial resources. As such, unfavourable changes in the value of cryptoassets may have a knock-on consequence on the development of the Minima Blockchain and its ecosystem, which may consequently impact the value of Minima.</p><ol start="8"><li><strong>Lack of information for monitoring their Minima</strong></li></ol><p>You may not be able to obtain all information you want from time to time regarding the Minima Blockchain and Minima. Even if you do receive such information, you may not receive it on a timely basis. It is possible that you may not be aware of materially adverse changes that have occurred with respect to the Minima Blockchain and/or Minima in a timely manner. As a result of these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, you may not have accurate or accessible information relating to your purchase, which could prevent you from taking actions with the potential to prevent adverse consequences relating to your holding of Minima.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="schedule-2-content-standards">SCHEDULE 2: CONTENT STANDARDS<a href="#schedule-2-content-standards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SCHEDULE 2: CONTENT STANDARDS" title="Direct link to SCHEDULE 2: CONTENT STANDARDS">​</a></h2><p>All Content, and the content of Custom Tokens, must comply with Applicable Law, and must not:</p><ul><li>Be defamatory of any person.</li><li>Be obscene, offensive, hateful or inflammatory.</li><li>Bully, insult, intimidate or humiliate.</li><li>Promote sexually explicit material.</li><li>Include child sexual abuse material.</li><li>Promote violence.</li><li>Promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age.</li><li>Infringe any copyright, database right or trade mark of any other person.</li><li>Be likely to deceive any person.</li><li>Breach any legal duty owed to a third party, such as a contractual duty or a duty of confidence.</li><li>Promote any illegal content or activity, or otherwise contain harmful material.</li><li>Encourage behaviour prejudicial to health or safety.</li><li>Cause physical, mental or moral detriment to persons under the age of 18, or otherwise directly exhort such persons to purchase or rent goods or services in a manner which exploits their inexperience or credulity.</li><li>Be in contempt of court.</li><li>Be threatening, abuse or invade another&#x27;s privacy, or cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety.</li><li>Be likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person.</li><li>Impersonate any person or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person.</li><li>Give the impression that the content emanates from us if this is not the case.</li><li>Advocate, promote, incite any party to commit, or assist any unlawful or criminal act such as (by way of example only) copyright infringement or computer misuse.</li><li>Contain a statement which you know or believe, or have reasonable grounds for believing, that members of the public to whom the statement is, or is to be, published are likely to understand as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.</li></ul><p>The Content Standards above must be complied with in spirit as well as to the letter.
