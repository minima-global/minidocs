#### A 3. CONTACT DETAILS

3.1 If you have any queries:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.1 in relation to your Node, you can contact us by email at querysupport@minima.global;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.2 in relation to anything else, you can contact us by email at info@minima.global.

3.2 Communications between us shall be in English. Should we receive a communication which purports to be from you, we are entitled, but are not obliged, to rely on and conclusively presume that such communication has been given by you. We may record and monitor conversations we have with you.

3.3 You must keep your information with us up to date, as any communication we send using the details you provide us will be deemed received by you, regardless of whether or not you actually receive it.

3.4 You accept that we are deemed to have received any correspondence only at the time we actually access it. You accept that there may be a delay in responding to correspondence received.

#### A 4. SETTING UP AND SECURITY

4.1 As part of setting up your account, you will be provided with a seed phrase and are able to set a password (we strongly encourage you to set a strong password and keep it safe, as you are responsible of any loss as a consequence of your seed phrase or password being compromised). You must keep these secure and not disclose them to anyone else. Any action or instruction by anyone using your password or seed phrase will be treated as if such action or instruction had been made by you, and we are not responsible for any loss as a result. If your password is compromised, you may use your seed phrase to rest your password, however there is no way to replace your seed phrase if it is compromised.

4.2 **We strongly recommend logging out of the MiniDapps at the end of every session you have on them, as otherwise someone else may impersonate you, for example to deal in Cryptoassets, or to send or receive Content without your knowledge or consent. We are not responsible for any losses as a consequence of your failure to log out at the end of a session or your password or seed phrase otherwise being compromised.**

4.3 **Furthermore, whilst we intend for MiniDapps we provide to be secure, the open nature of the Minima Blockchain ecosystem means that it is possible for, and we encourage, people to create their own versions of MiniDapps as well as to build other applications in connection with the Minima Blockchain, including by amending of the source code we use to provide MiniDapps. Whilst these variations and applications may be similar to, and may even seek to impersonate, our MiniDapps, they are outside of our control and we are responsible for them. It is therefore vital that you should make sure that you only use applications where you are sure of their provenance and security, and that they are suitable for your requirements.**

#### A 5. YOUR OBLIGATIONS

5.1 At all times when using any of MiniDapps (and otherwise dealing in Minima), you confirm and represent that:

Save as aforesaid, the participants do not intend that the provisions of these Terms shall be enforceable by any person not a party to these Terms. Notwithstanding this clause A15.4, the consent of any third party is not required for any variation (including any release or compromise of any liability) or termination of these Terms.

15.5 To the extent that we may be deemed by any Applicable Law to owe you any fiduciary duties or to be in a fiduciary relationship, we explicitly exclude and reject any such duties or relationship to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

15.6 No variation or waiver of any of the terms of these Terms shall be effective unless agreed by us explicitly in writing. No failure or delay by us to exercise any right, power or remedy under these Terms shall operate as a waiver of that right, or any other right, nor shall any single or partial exercise by us of any right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of that right or any other right, power or remedy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.1 shall not allow the Wallet MiniDapp to be used in connection with any activities that are prohibited by Applicable Law;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.2 shall not use the Wallet MiniDapp in connection with dealing in cryptoassets that the Minima Blockchain does not support (such as ERC-20 Tokens);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.3 have full legal right to all Cryptoassets stored via the Wallet MiniDapp, and they are in no way derived from illegal activity; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.4 shall notify us without undue delay of any unauthorised use and / or access of the Wallet MiniDapp.

#### B 3. CONDITIONS FOR USE AND LIABILITY

3.1 By using the Wallet MiniDapp, you acknowledge and accept that we assume no responsibility in connection with any attempt to use the Wallet MiniDapp for cryptoassets that the Minima Blockchain does not support.

3.2 You can create a Custom Token by entering a URL via the Wallet MiniDapp. You must ensure that any Custom Token you create complies at all times with our Content Standards.

#### B 4. CESSATION OF SUPPORT

---

## SECTION C: MINIDAPP FOR TRANSACTING: ETH WALLET

#### C 1. ETH WALLET MINIDAPP

1.1 You can use the ETH Wallet MiniDapp to send, receive, swap, self-custody and monitor ETH and other ERC-20 Tokens.

#### C 2. YOUR REPRESENTATIONS WHEN USING THE ETH WALLET MINIDAPP

2.1 In addition to complying with your obligations set out at clause A5, when using the ETH Wallet MiniDapp you confirm and represent at all times that you:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.1 shall not allow the ETH Wallet MiniDapp to be used in connection with any activities that are prohibited by Applicable Law;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.2 shall not use the ETH Wallet MiniDapp in connection with dealing in Cryptoassets which do not meet the ERC-20 token standard;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.3 have full legal right to all ERC-Tokens stored via the ETH Wallet MiniDapp, and they are in no way derived from illegal activity; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.4 shall notify us without undue delay of any unauthorised use and / or access of the ETH Wallet MiniDapp.

#### C 3. MAKING A SWAP

3.1 In order to use the ETH Wallet MiniDapp to make a swap, you will need to select which Cryptoasset you wish to dispose of, confirm the amount you wish to dispose of, and the Cryptoasset you wish to acquire. The MiniDapp will then provide you with a proposed estimated exchange rate, which reflects the rate(s) provided by the third party providers the MiniDapp is connected with. If you proceed with a swap, it will be completed via a third party smart contract and you will then receive the resulting Cryptoassets back via the ETH Wallet MiniDapp.

3.2 As third party providers are used to complete each swap, please note that the exchange rates provided are an estimated rate at the time you request the rate. The actual rate provided, and so the amount of a Cryptoasset you obtain from a swap, will be determined at the time you initiate the swap. **As the prices of Cryptoassets can be highly volatile, we do not guarantee that the amount of Cryptoassets you acquire from a swap will be the same as that set out in the proposed exchange rate. Rather, it will reflect the rate actually obtained from the third party providers when the swap is actually executed by the smart contract (which may result in you receiving more or less of the Cryptoasset than that predicted by the estimated exchange rate you receive).**

#### C 4. CONDITIONS FOR USE AND LIABILITY

4.1 By using the ETH Wallet MiniDapp, you acknowledge and accept that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1.1 you will only be able to make a swap if there are sufficient Cryptoassets stored via your ETH Wallet MiniDapp to do so;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1.2 once an instruction to make a swap has been made, you are not able to cancel that swap (or otherwise ask for a refund), and as such before making any swap you should make sure that you are certain you want to proceed; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1.3 we assume no responsibility in connection with any attempt to use the ETH Wallet MiniDapp for cryptoassets other than supported Cryptoassets.

4.2 In addition to our general disclaimer on liability set out at clause A8, as long as we act in good faith, we do not accept responsibility for loss as a consequence of anything you accept responsibility for under this clause C4.

#### C 5. LIABILITY

5.1 In addition to our general disclaimer on liability set out at clause A8, as long as we act in good faith, we do not accept responsibility for loss as a consequence of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1.1 any swap not being accepted by the connected third party provider;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1.2 any difference between the exchange rate quoted in relation to a proposed swap and the rate obtained from the relevant third party provider; or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1.3 any delay in processing a swap.

#### C 6. CESSATION OF SUPPORT

6.1 We will provide reasonable advance notice of ceasing to support the ETH Wallet MiniDapp. You must withdraw all Cryptoassets stored utilising the ETH Wallet MiniDapp before the date we cease supporting it, as we will no longer maintain the ETH Wallet MiniDapp after this date.

---

## SECTION D: MINIDAPP FOR TRANSACTING: PUBLIC (MEGA) WALLET

#### D 1. PUBLIC (MEGA) WALLET

1.1 Unlike MiniDapps generally, the Public (Mega) Wallet can be set up by running a specific command on the Node to enable public mds.

1.2 You can use the Public (Mega) Wallet to set up and host a public facing wallet which anyone with the relevant password (“Users”) can assess to:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2.1 mint NFTs and Custom Tokens on the Minima Blockchain;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2.2 send, receive, self-custody and monitor their Cryptoassets; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2.3 see their transaction history in connection with the Public (Mega) Wallet.

1.3 When using the Public (Mega) Wallet, transactions in Cryptoassets are processed by the host computer of the Public (Mega) Wallet. Whilst the public wallet host can see which wallet addresses are interacting, it cannot identify or record who the User of each wallet is and does not have the ability to deal in a User's cryptoassets.

1.4 **Unlike other MiniDapps, the Public (Mega) Wallet is made available as a web page, meaning that Users (including, but not limited to, those Users using iOS) are able to access the Public (Mega) Wallet without running a Minima Node. Hosts of the Public (Mega) Wallet will need to run a Node on a server with a static, public facing IP address in order to provide the Public (Mega) Wallet to Users. It is your responsibility to ensure that you use the compatible operating system in relation to the Public (Mega) Wallet.**

#### D 2. YOUR REPRESENTATIONS WHEN USING THE PUBLIC WALLET MINIDAPP

2.1 In addition to complying with your obligations set out at clause A5, when using the Public (Mega) Wallet you confirm and represent at all times that you and all Users:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.1 shall not allow the Public (Mega) Wallet to be used in connection with any activities that are prohibited by Applicable Law;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.2 shall not use the Public (Mega) Wallet in connection with dealing in cryptoassets that the Minima Blockchain does not support (such as ERC-20 Tokens); and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.3 have full legal right to use the Public (Mega) Wallet, and it shall not be used in connection with any Cryptoassets in any way derived from illegal activity.

#### D 3. CONDITIONS FOR USE AND LIABILITY

3.1 By using the Public (Mega) Wallet, you are at all times responsible for ensuring that all Users accept that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.1 they are dealing in Cryptoassets and as such clause A5 shall apply to them as if references to “you” are reference to Users; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.2 they are responsible for keeping, protecting and safeguarding their seed phrase, and we are not responsible for any loss as a consequence of seed phrases being lost or otherwise compromised.

3.2 You are responsible for ensuring that Users understand their obligations in connection with the Public (Mega) Wallet, and you are liable for their failure to comply with such obligations as if that failure has been by you.

3.3 In addition to our general disclaimer on liability set out at clause A8, as long as we act in good faith, we do not accept responsibility for loss as a consequence of anything Users accept responsibility for under this clause D3.

#### D 4. CESSATION OF SUPPORT

4.1 We will provide reasonable advance notice of ceasing to support the Public (Mega) Wallet. Users must withdraw all Cryptoassets stored utilising the Public (Mega) Wallet before the date we cease supporting it, as we will no longer maintain the Public (Mega) Wallet after this date.

## SECTION E: MINIDAPP FOR TRANSACTING: FUTURE CASH

#### E 1. FUTURE CASH MINIDAPP

1.1 The Future Cash MiniDapp enables you to lock Cryptoassets and then send them to either your or someone else’s wallet at a future chosen point in time (the “Release Date”).

1.2 The Release Date you select is a rough approximation calculated by reference to the general average times taken for a block to be processed on the Minima Blockchain. As such, the actual date on which the Future Cash MiniDapp sends Cryptoassets may be (substantially) different to the estimated date provided to you when you instruct Future Cash MiniDapp.

#### E 2. CONDITIONS FOR USING FUTURE CASH MINIDAPP

2.1 By using Future Cash MiniDapp, you are dealing in Cryptoassets and clause A5 shall apply. In addition, you acknowledge and accept that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.1 you shall not use the Future Cash MiniDapp in connection with Cryptoassets that the Minima Blockchain does not support (such as ERC-20 Tokens), and we are not responsible for any loss as a consequence of you not complying with this obligation;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.2 you may only use the Future Cash MiniDapp to lock Cryptoassets up to the amount you hold in your wallet at the time of instructing the Future Cash MiniDapp; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.3 once Cryptoassets have been locked using the Future Cash MiniDapp, you cannot unlock them or change the amount locked, nor can you alter the Release Date or destination wallet for the transfer. As such before making any transfer using the Future Cash MiniDapp you should make sure that you are certain you want to proceed.

#### E 3. LIABILITY FOR USING FUTURE CASH

3.1 In addition to our general disclaimer on liability set out at clause A8, as long as we act in good faith, we do not accept responsibility for loss as a consequence of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.1 any difference in the actual date on which Cryptoassets are sent using the Future Cash MiniDapp and the estimated date provided to you when you instruct the Future Cash MiniDapp to make the transfer;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.2 any inaccuracy in the Release Date or destination wallet details you supply;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.3 any delay in Cryptoassets being unlocked and sent to the destination wallet; or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.4 any defect in the destination wallet or the destination wallet otherwise not being compatible with the Cryptoassets sent.

#### E 4. CESSATION OF SUPPORT

4.1 In addition to the general position set out in clause A9, if the Future Cash MiniDapp ceases to be supported by us, this shall not affect any locked Cryptoassets which will continue to be sent to the destination wallet on the Release Date.

---

## SECTION F: MINIDAPP FOR TRANSACTING: VESTR

#### F 1. VESTR MINIDAPP

1.1 The Vestr MiniDapp enables you to lock Cryptoassets and then send them to either your or someone elses wallet on pre-selected future chosen dates (the “Vesting Dates”, and each a “Vesting Date”).

1.2 The Vesting Dates you select are a rough approximation calculated by reference to the general average times taken for a block to be processed on the Minima Blockchain. As such, the actual date on which the Vestr MiniDapp sends Cryptoassets may be (substantially) different to the estimated date provided to you when you instruct Vestr MiniDapp to make the transfer.

1.3 The Vestr MiniDapp is different from the Future Cash MiniDapp in that it is designed to allow Cryptoassets to be unlocked and distributed in installments, rather than as a single transaction.

#### F 2. CONDITIONS FOR USING VESTR MINIDAPP

2.1 By using Vestr MiniDapp, you are dealing in Cryptoassets and clause A5 shall apply. In addition, you acknowledge and accept that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.1 you shall not use the Vestr MiniDapp in connection with Cryptoassets that the Minima Blockchain does not support (such as ERC-20 Tokens), and we are not responsible for any loss as a consequence of you not complying with this obligation;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.2 you may only use the Vestr MiniDapp to lock Cryptoassets up to the amount you hold in your wallet at the time of instructing the Vestr MiniDapp; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.3 once Cryptoassets have been locked using the Vestr MiniDapp, you cannot unlock them or change the amount locked, nor can you alter the Vesting Dates or destination wallet for the transfer. As such before making any transfer using the Vestr MiniDapp you should make sure that you are certain you want to proceed.

#### F 3. LIABILITY FOR USING VESTR

3.1 In addition to our general disclaimer on liability set out at clause A8, as long as we act in good faith, we do not accept responsibility for loss as a consequence of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.1 any difference in the actual date on which Cryptoassets are sent using the Vestr MiniDapp and the estimated date provided to you when you instruct the Vestr MiniDapp to make the transfer;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.2 any inaccuracy in the Vesting Dates or destination wallet details you supply;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.3 any delay in Cryptoassets being unlocked and sent to the destination wallet; or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.4 any defect in the destination wallet or the destination wallet otherwise not being compatible with the Cryptoassets sent.

#### F 4. CESSATION OF SUPPORT

4.1 In addition to the general position set out in clause A9, if the Vestr MiniDapp ceases to be supported by us, this shall not affect any locked Cryptoassets which will continue to be sent to the destination wallet on the Vesting Dates.

---

## SECTION G: MINIDAPP FOR TRANSACTING: MAXIMIZE

#### G 1. MAXIMIZE MINIDAPP

1.1 The Maximize MiniDapp allows you to stake Minima and receive a fixed rate of yield (paid in Minima), in proportion to the amount of Minima staked. When you stake Minima it is immediately locked in a smart contract. The smart contract is self-executing code which we do not control (meaning you retain custody of your Minima). The smart contract will lock your Minima for a time you can select via the Maximize MiniDapp, after which your Minima will be unlocked along with the yield. The smart contract is designed to avoid counterparty risk.

1.2 We may from time to time alter the amount that can be staked, and the length of time for Minima can be staked. We will also have the ability to alter the yield paid out by the Maximize MiniDapp at our discretion, and this includes the Maximize MiniDapp ceasing to pay any yield.

#### G 2. CONDITIONS FOR USING MAXIMIZE

2.1 By using Maximize, you are dealing in Cryptoassets and clause A5 shall apply. In addition, you acknowledge and accept that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.1 you must not attempt to use Maximize to stake any Cryptoasset other than Minima; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.2 you are responsible for the custody of your Minima, and as such you are responsible for ensuring that you have a compatible wallet (such as the Wallet MiniDapp) in which you receive yield generated from staking.

#### G 3. LIABILITY FOR USING MAXIMIZE

3.1 In addition to our general disclaimer on liability set out at clause A8, as long as we act in good faith, we do not accept responsibility for loss as a consequence of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.1 your breach of any of the conditions for using Maximize, as set out at clause G2;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.2 the yield generated via staking not meeting your expectations; and / or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.3 any change in (or total loss of) the value of Minima.

#### G 4. CESSATION OF SUPPORT

4.1 In addition to the general position set out in clause A9, if we cease supporting the Maximize MiniDapp, any existing, locked stakes will remain unaffected but it will not be possible to create new stakes.

---

## SECTION H: MINIDAPP FOR TRANSACTING: MINISWAP

#### H 1. MINISWAP

1.1 The MiniSwap MiniDapp allows you to swap Minima on the Minima blockchain with ERC-20 Tokens.

#### H 2. USING THE MINISWAP MINIDAPP

2.1 To make a swap, you will need to find a counterparty with which to make a swap, and to agree which Cryptoassets are being swapped and the amount to be swapped. You can also send an open-ended invitation to counterparties to swap up to a certain amount of Cryptoassets at a certain exchange rate (subject to any limits set by the MiniSwap MiniDapp from time to time).

2.2 You and the counterparty will need to:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.1 have downloaded and activated accounts on the MiniSwap MiniDapp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.2 have a compatible wallet linked to the MiniSwap MiniDapp (the wallets we provide as MiniDapps are designed to be compatible); and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.3 agree the terms of the swap,

at which point the MiniSwap MiniDapp will swap the relevant amount of relevant Cryptoasset between the relevant wallets.

#### H 3. RESPONSIBILITY IN RELATION TO SWAPS

3.1 By using the MiniSwap MiniDapp, you are dealing in Cryptoassets and clause A5 shall apply. In addition, you acknowledge and accept that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.1 in order for a swap to be processed you and your counterparty will need to have sufficient Cryptoassets to satisfy the respective obligations under the swap; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.2 once the MiniSwap MiniDapp has accepted an instruction to make a swap, it cannot be cancelled or reversed, and as such before making any swap you should make sure that you are certain you want to proceed.

#### H 4. LIABILITY

4.1 In addition to our general disclaimer on liability set out at clause A8, as long as we act in good faith, we do not accept responsibility for loss as a consequence of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1.1 any swap not being accepted by any counterparty; or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1.2 any delay in processing a swap.

## SECTION J: MINIDAPPS FOR TRANSACTING AND COMMUNICATING: CHATTER

#### J 1. CHATTER

1.1 The Chatter MiniDapp allows you to send encrypted Content to all of your contacts (it is not possible to only send Content to certain contacts, rather if you wish to do that you should consider using the MaxSolo MiniDapp to send the Content to each contact you wish to receive it).

#### J 2. SENDING CONTENT

2.1 In receiving Content, you accept that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.1 messages are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and so caution should be exercised in reviewing all Content, and we shall not be responsible for any loss caused by phishing, spoofing or any other malicious attack;

## SCHEDULE 1: RISKS RELATING TO CRYPTOASSETS

**DEALING IN CRYPTOASSETS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK, AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN ONLY IF YOU ARE CAPABLE OF EVALUATING THE RISKS INVOLVED AND ABLE TO BEAR THE RISK OF A COMPLETE LOSS OF ALL CAPITAL USED TO PARTICIPATE IN CRYPTOASSETS. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE DEALING IN CRYPTOASSETS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE LIST OF RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED HEREUNDER IS NOT INTENDED TO BE EXHAUSTIVE AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDE ALL THE RISKS TO WHICH YOU MAY BE EXPOSED WHEN DEALING IN CRYPTOASSETS.**

We expressly disclaim all responsibility for any loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in this Schedule 1, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting from such information.

Please note that in addition to the risks below, there may be other risks associated with your dealing in Cryptoassets and using our MiniDapps generally, including those that we cannot reasonably foresee. Additional risks may also materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed below.

By participating in these Terms, or by otherwise dealing in Cryptoassets, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks, which we shall not be liable for should they materialize:

#### Risks applicable to all Cryptoassets (including Minima)

1. **General risks**

The value of the Cryptoassets can fall as well as rise. If you buy Cryptoassets, you may not get back the full amount you spent on them, or anything at all. The value of Cryptoassets may depend on fluctuations in the financial markets, or other economic factors, which are outside our control. The past performance of a Cryptoassets is not a guide to the future performance of Cryptoassets.

2. **The prices of Cryptoassets are extremely volatile**

Fluctuations in the price of Cryptoassets are subject to significant price volatility. The prices of Cryptoassets have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. A range of factors may influence the market price, if any, of Cryptoassets, including, but not limited to: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the ability (if any) of Cryptoassets to trade on a secondary market;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) global supply and demand;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) general expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates and exchange rates;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying Cryptoassets;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) changes in the rights, obligations, incentives, or rewards for holders of Cryptoassets;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) interruptions in service from or failures of exchanges on which Cryptoassets are traded;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) investment and trading activities of large purchasers, including private and registered funds, that may directly or indirectly invest in Cryptoassets;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x) regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of Cryptoassets and changes in Applicable Law;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(xi) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(xii) expectations among participants that the value of a particular Cryptoasset or Cryptoassets generally will soon change.

A decrease in the price of a single cryptoasset may cause volatility in the entire cryptoasset industry and may affect the Cryptoassets available via our MiniDapps. Volatility in the price of Cryptoassets may result in significant loss over a short period of time.

3. **Risk of losing access to Cryptoassets due to loss of private key(s) and wallet(s)**

A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to deal in Cryptoassets. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing Cryptoassets will result in loss of such Cryptoassets. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use (including the Minima Wallet), may be able to misappropriate your Cryptoassets.

Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the wallet you use to receive and store Cryptoassets, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such wallet, may also result in the loss of your Cryptoassets. Failure to precisely follow any procedures set forth by us for dealing in Cryptoassets, including, for instance, providing an incorrect wallet address, or using incompatible wallet(s), may result in the loss of Cryptoassets you hold.

4. **Regulatory risks**

Regulation of Cryptoassets and the offering thereof, as well as blockchain technologies, and cryptoasset exchanges is currently underdeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve. Regulation varies significantly between different jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Regulators may in the future adopt laws, regulations, guidance or other actions that may severely impact the development and operation of MiniDapps and the adoption and utility of Cryptoassets.

5. **Risks associated with the blockchain protocol**

Because Cryptoassets are based on blockchain protocols, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of a blockchain protocol may have a material adverse effect on Cryptoassets. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to Cryptoassets by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the blockchain protocol.

6. **Risk of hacking and software and security weaknesses**

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with Cryptoassets in a variety of ways, including malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing, as well as attacks which overpower the consensus-based mechanism on which the blockchain is built and attacks which interfere with or otherwise cause nodes to malfunction (nodes are computers / hardware devices that help maintain the blockchain).

There is also an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories we use could contain Viruses or Vulnerabilities. Viruses or Vulnerabilities could cause, inter alia, complete loss of Cryptoassets, or could negatively affect the operation of MiniDapps.

7. **Forks and Airdrops**

The underlying protocols of Cryptoassets may be subject to substantial changes in their operating rules (called a “forks”), and these may alter the value or function of a Cryptoasset. A fork may result in multiple versions of a Cryptoasset, leading to volatility as one version becomes dominant over another, which may lose its value.

There may be additional distributions (called an “airdrop”) made to holders of a particular Cryptoasset, which may be a new variant of a Cryptoasset or a further quantity of the same Cryptoasset. The (anticipated) occurrence of an airdrop may impact the value of the Cryptoasset(s) affected by that airdrop.

8. **Other potential risks applicable to Cryptoassets**

In addition to the risks included in this Schedule 1, there are other risks associated with dealing in Cryptoassets, including those that we cannot reasonably foresee. Additional risks may also materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed above in this Schedule 1.

Where you deal in any Cryptoasset you should take care to understand the risks involved. It is usual for the issuer of the Cryptoasset to provide an explanation of the risks involved (or if they have not, this can be an indicator that a Cryptoasset is particularly risky as there has been a lack of consideration of the risks relevant to that Cryptoasset). By dealing in any Cryptoasset, you confirm to us that you have taken to time to understand, and accept, the risks involved (including in respect of the risks as explained by the issuer of the Cryptoasset).

#### Minima specific risks

As noted elsewhere in these Terms, Minima is not sold as securities nor any other form of regulated investment product. Accordingly, there has not been any consideration as to whether the Minima is a suitable or an appropriate thing for you to deal in. In addition to the risks applicable to all Cryptoassets as detailed above, you should be aware of the following risks in relation to Minima specifically:

1. **Lack of operating history**

Purchases of Minima involve a high degree of risk. The utility and value of Minima is reliant on the success of the Minima Blockchain and ecosystem. As such, Minima has all of the risks and uncertainties normally associated with developing and operating a blockchain, lack of name recognition, potential lack of resources, difficulties in complying with all Applicable Law, and reliance on the development of the Minima Blockchain ecosystem. These risks are significant.

2. **Risks associated with uncertain regulation**

The regulatory status of the Minima may be unclear or unsettled in certain jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to Minima and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, such as the Minima Blockchain. Regulatory actions could negatively impact Minima in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Minima is a regulated financial instrument that requires registration or licensing. Participants in Minima may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to Applicable Law, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or if it becomes commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

More generally, the Minima Blockchain is pioneered on new and evolving technology, which increases legal complexity, particularly as the Applicable Law is subject to interpretation and change. This could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines as well as the requirement that some or all MiniDapps are restricted or prohibited in certain jurisdictions. These developments could have an adverse effect on the operations of the Minima Blockchain and the value of Minima.

3. **Legal proceedings and litigation**

From time to time, participants in Minima may be involved in legal proceedings or litigation. The results of such legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and, regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on the development of the Minima Blockchain ecosystem. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect people’s perception of the Minima Blockchain ecosystem, regardless of whether the allegations are valid. Accordingly, litigation may adversely affect the value of Minima.

4. **Intellectual property**

Companies, organisations, or individuals, including competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks, or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with the use and development of Minima and the Minima Blockchain, which could make it more difficult for the Minima Blockchain ecosystem to operate, reducing the value of Minima.

5. **Minima will have no refund rights or similar features and may have limited liquidity**

After issuance, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law you will have no ability to return Minima or to receive a refund or otherwise require that Minima be exchangeable for a certain value. As a result, if there is not sufficient demand or interest in the Minima Blockchain or Minima, or if there are limits on the transferability of, or limited liquidity for, Minima, then it may be of less value to participants.

6. **Future distribution of Minima and other types of token**

The distribution of a substantial number of Minima or additional types of token could have an adverse effect on the value of Minima. Any distribution of Minima could dilute the percentage interest in then-outstanding Minima, and have an adverse effect on the market value of the Minima. Additional new types of cryptoasset may also impact the value of Minima, and you have no rights in relation to such new types of cryptoasset as a result of entering into these Terms.

7. **Developing the ecosystem**

The ecosystem around the Minima Blockchain requires resources to develop and maintain, including financial resources. As such, unfavourable changes in the value of cryptoassets may have a knock-on consequence on the development of the Minima Blockchain and its ecosystem, which may consequently impact the value of Minima.

8. **Lack of information for monitoring their Minima**

You may not be able to obtain all information you want from time to time regarding the Minima Blockchain and Minima. Even if you do receive such information, you may not receive it on a timely basis. It is possible that you may not be aware of materially adverse changes that have occurred with respect to the Minima Blockchain and/or Minima in a timely manner. As a result of these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, you may not have accurate or accessible information relating to your purchase, which could prevent you from taking actions with the potential to prevent adverse consequences relating to your holding of Minima.
