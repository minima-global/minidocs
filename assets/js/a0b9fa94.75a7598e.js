For all miner-centric coins, this is a problem. How can trillions be transacted off-chain when only millions are spent in fee-paying transactions securing layer 1? Clearly, these layered systems are only as secure as the security of their lower levels. Less money spent equals fewer fees paid. So either layer 2 works, it scales, and everyone jumps off-chain, reducing layer 1 security by starving miners on-chain... or layer 2 does not work, users stay on layer 1, all the on-chain miners get paid, but it can\u2019t scale...
