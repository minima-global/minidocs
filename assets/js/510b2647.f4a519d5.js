Essentially these techniques require users to connect to the network periodically, at best - constantly, at worst - daily or weekly. Then their MMR proofs can be updated, the validity of the chain\u2019s transactions can be verified independently and correct additions can be made to the Cascading Proof Chain, before the relevant data is discarded by the network.
