# Exporting to MySQL
 
It is possible to export your node's archive blocks to an external MySQL database for storage. 

Using a MySQL database to hold a backup of your archive data means you can:
- update the MySQL db with the archive blocks from your node
- chain or seed re-sync directly from the MySQL database for any Minima node (if made publicly available);
- export the archive blocks from MySQL to a .dat or .gzip file to be shared for re-syncing purposes;
- execute SQL queries on all coins since the Genesis block (NEW for v 1.0.39);
- export the tables from MySQL to a SQL file;
- import the SQL file to another MySQL database

This setup uses two Docker containers
1. a Minima archive node 
2. a MySQL database to hold the archive blocks and coins

The archive database in MySQL will contain 3 tables:
1. cascadedata - if your archive node does not start at the genesis block, there may be cascade data
2. syncblocks - the archive blocks
3. coins (NEW v1.0.39) - a coins table of all coins in the archive blocks

## Prerequisites

- An existing archive node running in Docker

## Minima - MySQL setup

1. Install MySQL Workbench from the [official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/), selecting the Operating System relevant to you

2. Open your Terminal/Command Line interface
 
3. Setup a Docker network, this will allow you to connect your node to your MySQL database that we will create in the next step

```
docker network create -d bridge minimanetwork
```

Now you should see **minimanetwork** listed if you run 

```
docker network ls
```

4. Start a MySQL database as a Docker container

You will need to set your own values for the following parameters:
- MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD : create a root password
- MYSQL_DATABASE : create a name for the archive database
- MYSQL_USER : create a user for the archive database
- MYSQL_PASSWORD : create a password for the MYSQL_USER

```
docker run -d -p 3307:3306  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourrootpassword -e MYSQL_DATABASE=archivedb -e MYSQL_USER=archiveuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=youruserpassword --restart unless-stopped --network=minimanetwork --label=com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false --name minimysql mysql:8.0
```

This will create a Docker container called **minimySQL** which runs your MySQL database called **archivedb**.

It will run on your port 3307 (mapped to 3306 in Docker); create the user specified and give them access to the database; connect the MySQL db to the **minimanetwork** Docker network; and disable Watchtower updates for the container. 


5. Connect your Minima archive node container to the **minimanetwork** Docker network

```
docker network connect minimanetwork minimaarchive
```

You should now see your **minimysql** and **minimaarchive** containers in the same network if you run:
```
docker network inspect minimanetwork
```
Output:
```
docker network inspect minimanetwork
[
    {
        "Name": "minimanetwork",
...
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Containers": {
            "182c4041ad365669b365ee6e0691e5488596ab1e974b791bba1306c74643bd03": {
                "Name": "minimaarchive",
...""
            },
            "38906df591a5ba642e755509e8c162e114b6dd56abc2ec2e76a0c673f5187b09": {
                "Name": "minimysql",
...
```

6. Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection with the following parameters

**Connection name:** minimaarchive<br/>
**Hostname:** 127.0.0.1 (or your public IP if running on a server)<br/>
**Port:** 3307<br/>
**Username:** root<br/>
**Password:** Click on “Store in Vault” and enter the root password you used in step 4 above. <br/>

7. Click Test Connection, then OK.

This will setup a connection to the MySQL database running in Docker.

## Update MySQL

To update the MySQL tables with the archive blocks from your node:

1. Open Minima Docker CLI or Minima Terminal MiniDapp

2. Optional - run the command `mysql action:info` with your login details to check the current status 

```
mysql host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:info
```

<details>
<summary> Example output </summary>

```
{
  "command":"mysql",
  "params":{
    "host":"minimysql",
    "database":"archivedb",
    "user":"archiveuser",
    "password":"youruserpassword",
    "action":"info"
  },
  "status":true,
  "pending":false,
  "response":{
    "archive":{
      "archivestart":1,
      "archiveend":72106,
      "archivetotal":72105
    },
    "mysql":{
      "mysqlstart":-1,
      "mysqlend":-1,
      "mysqltotal":0
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, the Minima archive db contains 72105 blocks and the mysql has 0 blocks, as expected.

</details>



:::important before updating
Before running an update, you must check your node is on the correct tip block. Run the `status` command to check your tip block is up to date.
:::

3. Update the MySQL database with the Minima archive data and wait for it to finish

```
mysql host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:update
```

<details>
<summary> Example output </summary>

```
{
  "command":"mysql",
  "params":{
    "host":"minimysql",
    "database":"archivedb",
    "user":"archiveuser",
    "password":"youruserpassword",
    "action":"update"
  },
  "status":true,
  "pending":false,
  "response":{
    "archive":{
      "archivestart":1,
      "archiveend":72206,
      "archivetotal":72205
    },
    "mysql":{
      "mysqlstart":1,
      "mysqlend":72206,
      "mysqltotal":72205
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

Future updates will be incremental, only syncing the new blocks that are not already in the MySQL database.

### Auto update

To automatically update the MySQL database daily, run:

```
mysql host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:autobackup enable:true
```

## Check the integrity

To check that there are no missing blocks in the MySQL database, you can run:

```
mysql action:integrity host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword
```

## Export to an archive file

### .dat file export

From v1.0.39 onwards, a **.raw.dat** export can be used by users to recover their node via the Security minidapp or with the [reset](/docs/userguides/usingyournode/terminal_commands) command. This is the recommended method.

Optionally omit the `file` parameter to use an autogenerated file name. 

```
mysql action:rawexport file:archiveexport.raw.dat host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword
```

### .gzip file export 

This .gzip export can be used by users to archive reset their node via the Security minidapp or with the [reset](/docs/userguides/usingyournode/terminal_commands#backup) command.

```
mysql  action:h2export file:archiveexport.gzip host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword
```

## Resync from MySQL

If a user has been offline for too long and cannot resync to the chain from the IBD alone, or has lost access to their node, they can connect to a MySQL database to perform a chain or seed resync, provided it is publicly accessible.

This is an alternative option to re-syncing from an archive node.

As with archive nodes, there are two options when using a MySQL database to re-sync your a node:

- **Chain re-sync:** If a user has been offline for too long and their node is not on the correct tip block, they can re-sync to the latest block by performing a [chain re-sync](#to-perform-a-chain-re-sync) from a MySQL database. **The node will NOT be wiped during this process.**

- **Seed re-sync:** If a user does not have a valid backup or has lost access to their node, they can restore access to their coins by performing a [seed re-sync](#to-perform-a-seed-re-sync) from a MySQL database using their 24 word seed phrase. **The node will first be wiped before the re-sync begins.**

:::important read-only access
To re-sync using credentials for a read-only user,  set the `user` and `password` parameters as the credentials for the read-only user you have set up in MySQL, and add `readonly:true` as a parameter in the following commands.
:::


### To perform a chain re-sync

1. On the node requiring a re-sync, check the connection to the MySQL database, changing the ip:port as required

```
mysql host:127.0.0.1:3307 database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:info
```

2. To start the chain re-sync, run

```
mysql host:mysqlhost:port database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:resync
```

Your coins will remain safe throughout this process. Once complete, you will be on the correct tip block.

### To perform a seed re-sync

1. On the node requiring a re-sync, connect to check the MySQL archive database

```
mysql host:127.0.0.1:3307 database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:info
```

2. To start the seed re-sync, run

```
mysql host:mysqlhost:port database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:resync phrase:\"24 WORDS HERE\"
```

Optionally set the number of keys and keyuses relevant to you. If not specified, the defaults are keys:80 and keyuses:1000

```
mysql host:mysqlhost:port database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:resync phrase:\"24 WORDS HERE\" keys:90 keyuses:2000
```



## Check an address history

To check the unspent and spent coins for an address, run 

```
mysql host:127.0.0.1:3307 database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:addresscheck address:0x79...
```

## Create a coins table

To create a table in your MySQL archive database for all spent and unspent coins, you can use the `mysqlcoins` command. 

The coins table will be populated from the syncblock table, so this must be populated first. You can then run any SQL command against it to query the coins. 

:::note
The coins database is large and will take a while to populate, optionally you can create a second database in mysql workbench to keep the coinsdb separate to your existing archivedb.
:::

To populate the coins table, you can choose to specify the number of coins to update in one go by using the `maxcoins` parameter. To update the table will all the coins, remove the `maxcoins` parameter.

The example below adds the first 100 coins to the database. Next time, it will start from where it left off. 

**From any node**
```
mysqlcoins action:update maxcoins:100 host:127.0.0.1:3307 database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword 
```

**From docker**
```
mysqlcoins action:update maxcoins:100 host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword 
```

## Query the coins table

To search for all coins at an address or with the address in a state variable:

```
mysqlcoins action:search address: host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword 
```

To run a WHERE query on the coins table, string data MUST be in single quotes and you can use multiple parameters.

```
mysqlcoins action:search where: host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword 
```

To run a full SQL query on the coins table:

```
mysqlcoins action:search query: host:minimysql database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword 
```

For full help, use `help command:mysqlcoins` or see [here](/docs/userguides/usingyournode/terminal_commands).

## Export the tables from MySQL

To Export the archive data from MySQL to a file:

1. Open MySQL workbench

2. Double click on **minimaarchive** to open the database

3. From the **Administration** tab, select **Data Export** (also available from the Server dropdown menu)

![sql](/img/archivenode/F.AdminExportData.png#width50) 

4. Check the box for **archivedb** and check the boxes for **cascadedata** and **syncblock** 

:::warning
We do not recommend exporting the coins table as this will be very large.
:::

5. Under Export Options, select **Export to self-contained file** and **Include Create Schema**. Optionally change the file path.

![sql](/img/archivenode/G.DataExportSelection.png) 

6. Click **Start Export**

The exported file will be unzipped, you should zip the exported file to reduce your storage requirement. 

This file can be imported to MySQL if required.
