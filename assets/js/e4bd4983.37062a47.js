Should a user not keep track of his coins, they would not be lost, but he would need a third party to help recover them. He would need to find either an archive node that stores everything \u2013 for the purposes of selling the data in this exact scenario, or have previously set up a friend or chat group to keep track of extra coins (coin-proofs pose no security issues), and have them rediscover the individual MMR proofs for their coins."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Minima goes MMR real-time.
