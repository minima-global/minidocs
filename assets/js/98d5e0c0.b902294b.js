A soft-fork is a reduction in the chains\u2019 abilities. All Full nodes still see a valid block, just with a reduced solution space. Permanent censorship of a transaction or address is a soft-fork, since only those involved in the construction of the chain have any say. On fixed block size blockchains, a reduction in block size is a soft fork, as it still appears valid to all the Full nodes, just a smaller block. A hard fork is when all nodes need to agree to an increase in capabilities, adding an ability that was not there before. On fixed block size blockchains, an increase in the block size requires everyone to agree, as it is invalid to Full nodes given the old rules, that specified a lower maximum block size. Adding a new function or feature is a hard fork. Upgrading or fundamentally changing the protocol is a hard fork."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Soft forks are much easier to implement than hard forks since only a majority of the much smaller group of Complete nodes needs to agree.
