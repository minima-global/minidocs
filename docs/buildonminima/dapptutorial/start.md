# Start

There is no “right” way to create decentralized applications on Minima. You may choose your own path and technologies that you are most comfortable using.

It is likely more desirable and of interest to build dApps to be as decentralised as possible which is what Minima facilitates by having complete nodes on mobile devices. **Pure sovereignty over your data.**

As developers, we must be extra creative while developing MiniDapps, considering efficient methods to distribute and store data, lower power usage, and grant the smoothest user experience.


## Pre-requisites

There are no special hardware requirements for building a MiniDapp. 

Before you start to create MiniDapps, you will need a code editor to write your code, for example [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but this is your own preference.

If you haven't already, we recommend you gain a thorough understanding of the Minima Protocol by reading the [Learn](/docs/learn/ataglance) section. 

**Let’s begin.**
