# Get Involved

import AddWMINIMA from '../../src/components/AddWMINIMA/index.js';

## Running a node

Start by [running your own Minima node](/docs/runanode/get_started)!

You will get a non-custodial native Minima wallet; a suite of of default MiniDapps to start using; and direct access to the blockchain.  

Once up and running, you can participate by interacting in the community, and using the social MiniDapps like Chatter. Simply [set up your profile](/docs/userguides/usingmaxima/yourprofile) and then [share your contact address](/docs/userguides/usingmaxima/managingcontacts) with other users.

## Building MiniDapps

If youâ€™re a developer, check out the [Build section](/docs/buildonminima/buildintro) of our docs to learn about how to build your own MiniDapps and how to write smart contracts on Minima.

- expected to be available to purchase on exchanges in 2024.

**WMINIMA** (wrapped Minima):
- the wrapped version of native MINIMA that lives on the Ethereum blockchain,
- can be traded on a 1:1 basis with native MINIMA,
- currently available to purchase from [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) or [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/WMINIMA_USDT).


### How do I see WMINIMA in Metamask?

If you have purchased WMINIMA and are holding it in a Metamask wallet, WMINIMA needs to be [added as a custom token](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-display-tokens-in-MetaMask#h_01FWH492CHY60HWPC28RW0872H) in MetaMask before you can view your balance. 

The WMINIMA contract address is: `0x669c01CAF0eDcaD7c2b8Dc771474aD937A7CA4AF`

Alternatively, if you have Metamask enabled on this browser page, click on the button below to add it automatically.
